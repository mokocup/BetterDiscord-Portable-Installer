# Deprecated!
As of Feb 3rd 2025, this repository is fully deprecated and archived. Please check EnhancedDiscordInstaller https://github.com/mokocup/enhanced-discord-portable-installer

For reason, I want merge all sort of modded Discord into one Installer instead of making new repository for each one

# Better Discord Portable Installer
